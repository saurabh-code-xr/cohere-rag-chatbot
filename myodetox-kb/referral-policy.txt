## Do I Need a Referral?

In Ontario, you do not need a referral from a doctor to receive physiotherapy, chiropractic, or massage therapy. However, some extended health insurance providers may require a referral for reimbursement. Please check with your insurance provider to confirm if a doctor’s note is needed to process your claim.
